SOLUTION ALGORITHM:

Define function getRandomIngredient() to randomly select an ingredient from the array
Define function exploreAndCollect() to simulate user exploring and collecting ingredients:
    call getRandomIngredient() to get random ingredient
    Add the randomly selected ingredient to the inventory
    Display message/alert indicating the ingredient found

  Select a random ingredient from inventory
  determine the dish based on the selected ingredient
  display message/alert indicating the dish cooked and the ingredient used
  Remove ingredient from the inventory
  Call viewInventory() to display the updated inventory
Initialize an empty inventory array to store collected ingredients
Start a game loop:
  Display a prompt asking the player which action they would like to take (explore, cook, view, exit)
  Convert the users input to lowercase
  based on user input
    if 'explore' 
      call exploreAndCollect()
    if cook
